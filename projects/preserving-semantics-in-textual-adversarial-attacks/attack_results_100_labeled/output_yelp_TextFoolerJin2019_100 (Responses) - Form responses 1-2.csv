We opted not to eat there, as we were going to Rock Bottom after wards and I will get to that review later...\n\nSo the show was good.  There were moments that I think the comedians may have went off track and were just bantering, but luckily enough they rebound and got back to making everyone laugh instead of being uncomfortable.  There were a total of 4 comedians, the MC, and two opening acts for Crawford.  I actually really enjoyed them.  \n\nThe one or two things I didn't like about the place.  The bathrooms are in the lobby.  As this seems normal there is no separate area to enter back into the room without having to make your way through people who are waiting to be seated... This was/is stupid.  I was actually nervous that they were going to stop me and ask for my ticket which they safely secured at my first entrance.  The same also goes for smoking.  Since we were so early I took a break and it was again awkward reentering.  Maybe they need to have some type of system to get around this.  A stamped hand?  A ticket stub?  Not sure but I know I would have felt better unlike feeling like I was sneaking into the place.  \n\nI would definitely return to the Improv.  I just hope I always have a rather positive experience!

Take the oddness of this list and multiply it by 3... then you're getting close to imagining what Construction Junction is like. \n\nMake sure to enter this store with zero expectations, no particular items to buy, and an empty home. Sadly, my home is filled (though I really wanted that 1960s desk...), and I had an item to buy (a filing cabinet). We left empty handed and drove straight to Office Depot, where I purchased a $90 (vs $25 here) filing cabinet that was not locked, had smooth-running drawers, and is not scratched up. Even though I didn't find what I needed today, I cannot anticipate to return here in the future.","TEXT1: If it wasn't for how fast and affordable the place is It would have no stars at all.

Here are my thoughts from my three visits:\n\nFirst time was for dinner (June 2014) with my Big Burrito Birthday Coupon. We sat outside, where it was pleasant even though it was the middle of the summer. They were generous with the table bread and I really liked their goat cheese yogurt spread. I got the Orrechiette chicken pasta and BF got the filet mignon. The pasta was ok (see lunch review for update) and came in a large portion. The filet mignon was perfection. I made BF share with me :) The roasted potatoes with the green chutney were also heavenly. Definitely a lovely way to spend my birthday.\n\nSecond time was for a weekday lunch with a college friend visiting (Nov 2014). We had the 2 $10 off entree coupons and ordered off the Gusto menu (a fancy version of Panera's You Pick Two). I got the Orrechiette again and a Turkey Avacado Sandwhich. The pasta was delicious this time, so I'm thinking it was just one-uped by the Filet Mignon at dinner. Friend got the vege risotto which she liked. I like that Casbah is willing to customize plates at no extra charge or nuisance - they removed all bacon items from my entire meal and replaced them with other dressings, etc. I really appreciated that. Even without the coupon the Gusto lunch menu is a great deal!\n\nThird time I went for brunch with another girlfriend (Dec 2014)\n. I LOVE BRUNCH and Casbah took the cake. The table scones, pastries etc were delicious as was the accompanying cinnamon butter. Our waiter was very nice and helpful and was again quick to help customize my vegetarian friend's needs. I got the Mimosa which was delicious. Smoked salmon appetizer was as good as the other yelpers say and the portion was humongous. Finally, I got the scallop omelette and they had no issue giving me my favorite home fries as the side instead of the grits. Friend got the salad appetizer and the spinach eggs benedict. She loved the eggs not such a big fan of the arugula salad (which I have had and liked). We each had a $10 off brunch which made this a steal :) We were able to sit outside even in the winter which was nice.\n\nAll in all, I love Casbah. I'm a student so it's a little expensive for me. But I go every chance I get. Look out for Big Burrito coupons!
