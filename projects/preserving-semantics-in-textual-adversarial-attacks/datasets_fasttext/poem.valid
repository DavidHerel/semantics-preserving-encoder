__label__2 my canoe to make more steady,
__label__1 and be glad in the summer morning when the kindred ride on their way;
__label__2 and when they reached the strait symplegades
__label__2 she sought for flowers
__label__2 if they are hungry, paradise
__label__0 indignantly i hurled the cry:
__label__0 with which his house is haunted;
__label__2 and, laying snow-white flowers against my hair.
__label__2 of long-uncoupled bed, and childless eld,
__label__2 of the boulder-strewn mountain, and when they will crop.
__label__1 on thine own bird the sweet enthusiasm
__label__2 said then the lost arch angel, this the seat
__label__2 a simple strain--
__label__2 his golden cross worn innermostly, (carved
__label__2 such days as thou, not even thou didst know,
__label__0 that we must change for heav'n, this mournful gloom
__label__1 lo now, o daughter of kings, let us rise in the face of the day,
__label__2 for penance, by a saintly styrian monk
__label__2 upon a mountain crag, young angelo--
__label__2 down in lovah's lane.
__label__2 as o'er the earth it wanders wide,
__label__1 how hearts were answering to his own,
__label__2 glad on its stone-built hearth; and thorough the wide-mouthed smoke-flue
__label__2 sees the clouds reel and roll above our head,
__label__0 ’tis to behold his vengeance for my son.
__label__0 i cannot tell rude listeners
__label__2 points beyond the midnight hour.
__label__2 i watch the fog float in at the window
__label__0 those wastes of frozen billows that were hurled
__label__0 we're perishing and blind!"
__label__1 may george, beloved by all the nations round,
__label__2 bertram finished the last pages, while along the silence ever
__label__2 half the tell-tale south-wind said,--
__label__2 he hid his gold,
__label__1 youth, i do adore thee;
__label__0 he stares, and shakes, and finds it vain to fly;
__label__2 i look up from this page of thine,
__label__2 of robert burns and alexander.
__label__2 crouching and sleeping neath its grassy lair,
__label__1 for her, though god has made her gentle and endearing,
__label__2 sings the blackened log a tune
__label__2 push every outpost nearer,
__label__2 that day.
__label__1 the life of love that gave it--settles.
__label__2 until my latest breath.
__label__2 the moon hath veiled her face,
__label__2 midway the floor (with thatch was it strewn) burned ever the fire-flame
__label__0 i rather should have hewn your limbs away,	-1
48	a wail of utter agony	-1
49	with shame his glowing cheeks, his eyes with fury burn’d.	-1
50	live with heav'ns choicest constant blessings crown'd!	1

__label__2 o that i were where helen lies
__label__2 o, mind ye, luve, how aft we left
__label__2 he might have been as doubtful once
__label__2 that i an accessary needs must be,
__label__2 a fleecy cloud,
__label__1 shall dwell in the house of my fathers and the land of the people's praise;
__label__1 dauntless he rose, and to the fight return’d;
__label__2 and if my bubbles be too small for you,
__label__0 to wakeful frenzy's vigil--rages,
__label__2 and through it, and round it, and over it all
__label__2 o graves of men who lived and died
__label__2 for the whole cardinals' college, or
__label__0 and the tree trembled, and the shouting cries
__label__2 blow bigger then your own:  the games we play
__label__1 the habitable earth is full of bliss;
__label__2 and yon outlying range invites
__label__2 but still within my bosom's core
__label__1 of your strong and pliant branches,
__label__2 sith i might some counsel find
__label__2 let sighing breezes call.
__label__2 (thy kingdom come) with his revealéd face
__label__1 i see the thing as clear as light,--
__label__2 fit for an abbot of theleme,
__label__2 and i turned away to thee,
__label__0 the fear of angels, awful though they be,
__label__2 down deep in the ground a box of gold.
__label__2 like those famed seven who slept three ages.
__label__2 their names let hands of horn and tan
__label__0 with the whole world gone blind,
__label__2 and, wildly tossed from cheeks and chin,
__label__2 of my wit or in my mind
__label__2 the night had found (to him a night of wo)
__label__0 but, fixing on the horrid maid his eye,
__label__2 roamed amongst the roses white and red.
__label__2 yea, soon, no consonant unsmooth
__label__2 from its stem the ripening ear--
__label__0 this endless outrage shall they still sustain?
__label__2 shall troy renew’d be forc’d and fir’d again?
__label__1 which overflows in notes of liquid gladness,
__label__1 where the warm life we cannot see--
__label__2 i met them one day and each had a flower
__label__2 thus while the trojan prince employs his eyes,
__label__2 they beached their galley on the shore, and sought
__label__2 shall live my highland mary.
__label__2 now is past since last we met
__label__2 begins to live
__label__2 beneath the hazel bough;
__label__2 daring to ask for naught, and having naught received.
