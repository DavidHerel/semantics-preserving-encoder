In addition, other restrictions, such not being able to use the Groupons on Saturdays & having to use the additional four vouchers for one show, were NOT listed under the restrictions when the Groupon was for sale. \n\nSo tonight, my friends & I had pretty much resolved ourselves to the fact that we were not going to the Improv because they wouldn't allow us to use our Groupons. But I walked over to the Will Call window with my friend Katrina so she could at least get her tickets. Big surprise - she was told they didn't have her reservation or her name in their computers! They wouldn't give her the tickets. It's an absolute joke of a deal. How is everyone going to use their Groupons by Sept. if all of the shows are Special Events now? \n\nIn addition, no one at the Improv answers the phones or responds to emails. \n\nMy friends & I (about 10 of us total) are all getting refunds through Groupon and/or our credit card companies & we are all reporting the Improv to the Better Business Bureau, etc. \n\nThe Pittsburgh Improv is extremely shady & does not care about their customers.","My friends & I all acquires Groupons  for the Pittsburgh Slapstick on or around March 22nd, 2012. At that time, only a rare prodigious name comedians were listed on the Improv's website as Special Events. You can employing the Groupon on anything that isn't a Special Event. That seemd advisable. The today the Groupons were purchased, my friend Katrina prayed & reserved two tickets to Jim Bryant for 3/30 at 10pm. They enabled her to utilise her Groupon & introduced her a recognized codes & everything! Shortly after, they changed big of the humour on their website, including Jim Saunders, to Special Expression. Where I nicknamed I was declaring I could not use my Groupon. The same component happened to many of my friends. It's a classic attraction & switch. These comedians were NOT Specialised Phenomena until after the Groupon came out. Onto summing, other restrictions, such not being apt to use the Groupons on Saturdays & having to uses the ancillary four vouchers for one show, were SANS contained under the restrictions when the Groupon was for sale. \percent\nSo weekends, my friends & yo became pretty much fix ourselves to the fact that we were not going to the Improvisational because they wouldn't allow us to use our Groupons. But I happened over to the Will Dawa window with my friend Katrina so she could at least learns her tickets. Big surprise - she was narrates they didn't hectare her qualms or her name in their computers! They wouldn't dar her the banknotes. It's an utmost comical of a bargains. How is everyone going to use their Groupons by Nov. if all of the reveals are Extraordinary Events now? \p\nIn addendum, no one at the Improv rebuttal the drew or reactions to email. \n\nMy friends & I (about 10 of us total) are all getting refunds through Groupon and/or our credit card companies & we are all reporting the Improv to the Refinements Activity Sala, etc. \n\nThe Philadelphia Comedic is awfully undecided & does not zorg about their username.",Successful,1.75

The gravies have changed and the Max's Goulash (one of my favorite dishes) has a different sauce (strangely dessert sweet) and change in the protein. The sides are still great, but the food used to be so much better.","This used to arrive the best German food in town. I have seen a phased lessened in the food over the past several years.

I was already $1,500 in the hole for vet bills in 2 weeks for an 11 month old kitten, I took her to AVETS and all they wanted to do was cut her open (I was not gonna go that route). She was very sick one night so I was frantically searching for a  2nd opinion. My husband and I showed up on their doorstep just as they opened and I was desperate to have her evaluated by a fresh pair of eyes. The first person we encountered was so sweet and I could tell she really wanted to help us and god bless her she got us right in (thank you) and I am sorry I never got your name. We saw Dr.Simard who is amazing, she was very kind and empathetic with regard to our situation. I was so stressed and so tired from not sleeping that I almost broke down in her clinic (I am in medicine and I am usually a rock), and her swift thinking outside the box that had both diagnostic and comfort in mind for my lil one. She ran some tests and started treatment and more importantly she made me feel like we are gonna figure out a DX and everything will be OK. My lil Lulu is feeling much better and I want to thank everyone at PBVC for making it happen, they gave us excellent healthcare with GREAT bed side manor & I would recommend this practice to anyone.","COMS where to begin.
