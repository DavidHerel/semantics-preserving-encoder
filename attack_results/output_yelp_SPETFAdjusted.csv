"I don't know what Dr. Goldberg was like before  moving to Arizona, but let me tell you, STAY AWAY from this doctor and this office. I was going to Dr. Johnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor.

"After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.\n\nWell, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.\n\nAnd yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.\n\nSo off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. \n\nWe walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'\n\nThis is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.\n\nOh...but good food counts too. \n\nWe each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!\n\nMy friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...\n\nThe waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. \n\nThey only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.\n\nEmil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.\n\nYou definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.\n\nAddendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly.

"I will start by saying we have a nice new deck. That is where the good part ends.\n\nWhy two stars if we have a nice deck now? Well, it all started in May when we had a man named Al come out and talk to us about the process. He was a true salesman, I'll tell you that. Not a straight shooter, but an excited salesman that wanted to sell... And we bought into it.\n\nHe told us they were backed up with the harsh winter and a lot of jobs, but they could probably start by June 24th. Mind you, this was the end of May we met with him. He said they would have to do a survey of our land and get a permit from Dormont before they started. We felt confident in going with them, and booked it.\n\nHere's where things fell apart. Weeks went by with no word from them on the process. Finally I called and left messages. Al finally got in touch with me and the conversation was utterly confusing. He must have not understood me because he just kept talking in circles. So I hung up not knowing what was going on. Finally I called back and the admin told me that the survey could take a couple weeks to come back. I wish Al would have told us that.\n\nSo our June 24th date came and went. We finally got our survey. And they were quick to bill us for it, but no word on where we were in the process. I called back a couple times with no real answers from the admin. Apparently they were now waiting for the permit from Dormont.\n\nA month later, I was frustrated and asked to speak with someone at the company. I spoke with someone who told me that Dormont usually takes a week to process the permit, but we were now going on a month. He told me he would bug the guy about it and we finally got it. \n\nI completely understand that waiting on the permit is not their fault, but why no communication about it? Just call me and tell me they're waiting for the permit, but they'll work towards asking Dormont what the hold up is. Seems simple.\n\nFinally we get the permit and work is supposed to start. Tuesday comes and they have to wait for approval from Dormont on holes they're digging. So holes are dug and equipment is put in my backyard and then nothing happens for two days. Where did everyone go? Who knows, because I wasn't informed! \n\nI was upset and contacted the company owner, Dave, by email. I told him how frustrated I was about the lack of communication. He wrote me two sentences that  said \""""there will be acres there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be done tomorrow.\"""" Well, that didn't happen.\n\nThen two other dudes show up two days later and did work for about three hours and left. The main guy comes back the next day and says they did it wrong. So apparently the part about how they wouldn't need access to my house changes to they're drilling bolts into my house to secure he deck. \n\nFinally, the second week into construction, my tiny 10x11 foot deck is done. It was upsetting that they left the deck dirty, and all the dirt and cement they moved around wasn't cleaned up. I even asked them to fill all the holes they dug up and didn't use, and they only filled up one. When you create a construction project, isn't it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice?

That is where the good portions end.\n\nWhy two stars if we have a nice deck now? Well, it all commencement in May when we had a man named Al coming out and conversation to us about the processed. He was a true seller, I'll tell you that. Not a straight gunman, but an excited seller that wanna to selling... And we bought into it.\n\nHe tell us they were backed up with the tough winter and a batch of job, but they could arguably commence by June 24th. Intellect you, this was the ends of May we met with him. He say they would have to do a surveyed of our land and get a permit from Dormont before they launch. We felt confident in going with them, and booked it.\n\nHere's where things dipped additionally. Weeks went by with no word from them on the processed. Ultimately I called and left messaging. Al ultimately get in touching with me and the conversation was totally confusing. He must have not comprehend me because he just preserved talking in circles. So I hung up not knowing what was going on. Eventually I called back and the admin tell me that the survey could take a coupling weeks to come back. I wish Al would have told us that.\n\nSo our June 24th dating came and went. We finally get our survey. And they were swiftly to invoices us for it, but no word on where we were in the process. I called back a couple times with no real answers from the managerial. Apparently they were now waiting for the permits from Dormont.\n\nA month later, I was frustrated and requested to speak with somebody at the enterprise. I spoke with someone who tell me that Dormont traditionally takes a week to processed the permissions, but we were now going on a month. He told me he would bug the dude about it and we finally got it. \n\nI fully comprehend that wait on the permissions is not their fault, but why no communicating about it? Righteous call me and told me they're awaits for the permissions, but they'll collaborate towards request Dormont what the hold up is. Seems simple.\n\nFinally we get the permissions and working is alleged to initiates. Monday happens and they have to expecting for approving from Dormont on keyholes they're excavated. So holes are dug and devices is put in my backyard and then nothing happens for two days. Where did everyone go? Who knows, because I wasn't informed! \n\nI was upset and contacted the company owner, Dave, by email. I told him how frustrated I was about the lack of communication. He wrote me two sentences that  said \""""there will be acres there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be done tomorrow.\"""" Well, that didn't happen.\n\nThen two other dudes show up two days later and did work for about three hours and left. The main guy comes back the next day and says they did it wrong. So apparently the part about how they wouldn't need access to my house changes to they're drilling bolts into my house to secure he deck. \n\nFinally, the second week into construction, my tiny 10x11 foot deck is done. It was upsetting that they left the deck dirty, and all the dirt and cement they moved around wasn't cleaned up. I even asked them to fill all the holes they dug up and didn't use, and they only filled up one. When you create a construction project, isn't it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice?

"Two meals, on the recommendation of a friend who lives near the place, and after the second trip, I was compelled to write. 'Rocky' would definitely describe the experiences.\n\nOn the first trip, I went to try their (at that time)raved about Reuben. And YET to find a true good Reuben in da burgh, I tried it.\n\nWell, they were out of the proper bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their 'raved about' Reubens, I received two mini-Reubens, which basically took the guts from one Reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. I ate it. It wasn't great, but they swore it was because they'd run out of the bread. Bread or not, it still wasn't great. The atmosphere was pleasant in that 'blue collar bar' kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the Reuben.\n\nThe second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. Sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen TV covering the sports of the moment.\n\nI was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. My friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops.\n\nWe hit the salad bar, which was uber-basic. Three soups (mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out), basic iceberg lettuce mix (very probably out of a bag), a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. It was a basic salad, no big deal. More or less an appetizer filler before the meal.\n\nThe mind-blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. Our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when I placed my order. I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to 'ask', and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat' and 'dark meat' meant. The first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre-portioned prepared bag, kind of Kentucky Fried Chicken style...which didn't answer my question, thus prompting the second trip. \n\nAfter the second trip back I heard the cook holler 'Tell him I'll fix him up'. \n\nWell, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like you'd find in the freezer case of Walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem-spuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green (parsley?), and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets.\n\nThank goodness for the basic salad bar.\n\nEven my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what she'd expected. They also appeared to be from a freezer bag.\n\nThe irony was that the boy who didn't know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers...about baseball...and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball. Ahhhh da burgh.\n\nThird base? Nah...why bother when there are so many other options around. Go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in Carnegie...they can help you out all types of ways in that area.

"Some of the worst pizza I've ever had.  We used a coupon from the paper for a 2 topping 8 cut Sicilian.

"I have to say that I write this review with much regret, because I have always loved PaPa J's. But my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit. \n\nFrom the minute we were seated, we were greeted by a server that was clearly inexperienced and didn't know the menu. As I said before, I've been to PaPa J's a good handful of times so I know the menu decently well, but the server couldn't explain any of the questions I had about a couple new dishes I was thinking about trying. I swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago.\n\nBut it wasn't just the knowledge of the menu. It was one thing after another with our server. My wife asked for a glass of water 4 times until she finally got it (at which point the meal was over, so we didn't care at that point).  I mean come on, for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water? There was no one filling up water.\n\nMy biggest complaint, however, is what happened with our meals. My dad and I both ordered the trout special (trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat). Instead, the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms. Not what the special was at all.  And by the way, that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server (which, we are sure it was) or the chef, who knows for certain. Not to mention, though, that a good server wouldn't have served us that regardless. \n\nBut before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server, let me continue. When we informed our server of the mistake, he didn't really believe us until he checked his order sheet, and then he blamed the error on the chef. At this point, the meal had been sitting (because it took us forever to flag this guy down again) so the trout was basically cold. The server then said he would have the meals re-made. So, he took the meals back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, of course, my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and I are sitting there with no meals. Also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for, and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda (yes, believe that or not). All the kitchen did was scrape their \""""mistake\"""" off of our fish! They didn't remake anything. Our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it. Quite frankly, the fish wasn't good at all. I honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from McDonald's that night. The server never did anything to try to make our experience better - he knew we weren't happy, but never offered anything such as dessert on the house. I'm not looking for a handout, but our experience was just plain awful that night. The guy never really even apologized for the mistake. Normally, I may have asked for a manager, but at this point I was ready to just get out of there (plus, we had to be somewhere else that night).\n\nMy opinion... for the money, there are many other restaurants I would rather eat at.","I have to say that I write this revisited with much regret, because I have permanently adored dad J's. But my recent experience there has amended my mind a bite. \n\nFrom the minute we were sitting, we were greeted by a server that was evidently inexperienced and didn't know the menu. As I says before, I've been to PaPa J's a good handful of times so I know the menus decently well, but the servers couldn't elucidate any of the questions I had about a coupling novel dishes I was thinking about attempting. I swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago.\n\nBut it wasn't just the knowledge of the menu. It was one thing after another with our server. My wife requested for a glass of water 4 times until she ultimately got it (at which point the meals was over, so we didn't caring at that point).  I mean coming on, for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to request for a glass of water? There was no one filling up water.\n\nMy larger complaint, however, is what transpired with our meal. My dad and I both decreed the trout special (trout with toast red peppers and lump crabmeat). Instead, the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of broccoli and mushroom. Not what the special was at all.  And by the path, that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the servers (which, we are sure it was) or the chef, who knows for certain. Not to mention, though, that a good servers wouldn't have served us that independently. \n\nBut before you think we had an unusal experience that was all owing to a poor server, letting me continuing. When we enlightened our server of the mistaken, he didn't really believe us until he audited his edict sheet, and then he blamed the errors on the chef. At this point, the meals had been sitting (because it took us forever to flag this guy down again) so the trout was mainly chilly. The servers then say he would have the meal re-made. So, he took the meals back to the cookery. Meanwhile, of course, my wife and mummy are food their meals and my dad and I are seated there with no meals. Also maintain in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for, and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda (yes, believe that or not). All the kitchen did was scrape their \""""mistake\"""" off of our fish! They didn't remake anything. Our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it. Quite frankly, the fish wasn't good at all. I honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from McDonald's that night.

"I'm not a huge fan of this location. I think that it was oddly built- the small, alley-like front makes it difficult to get past people on your way to/from the bathroom or tables when it's busy. And there's hardly any tables to sit at. Furthermore, people tend to clog the front on their way in, which makes things particularly difficult (especially in the winter weather).

"Before today I probably would have given this place three stars based mostly on their beer selection; however, today the service was terrible. We waited two hours for a pizza sub, French onion soup, fries, and buffalo chicken tenders.

We were told by the waitress that she realized it was wrong, but decided to still bring it out to see if my gf would eat it. She sent it back. By a half hour later, we still had not received the buffalo chicken tenders, nor the French onion soup (which should have been mostly made already), and no fries.

"I've been to Duke's three times now. When I first came to PGH, a lot of locals were telling me that this was a good place to catch a game, drink some brews and get great food.

"My boyfriend and I are in our 20s, and have visited this D&B multiple times. After our visit yesterday, however, I don't think we'll be back. When we arrived we were greeted by a long line of people waiting to buy game cards. At first there were 2 extremely slow workers trying to do this, then one left while the line was still out the door! The girl that was left was more than incompetent, and was taking extremely long to fill these game cards.

Needless to say, the line in the game room was just as long, and they still only had one girl in the booth. It was a Saturday!

We could see a divergence in the typing of crowed that was there on Saturday comparisons to what it used to be, and I'm I have no doubt it's due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness. For how costly they are they need to staff better on weekends. It's a shame how quick this placing has faded down hill and we will NOT be reverting anytime shortly!",Failed

"First off, I will say that I just moved here from California and was a big patron at the Rockbottom in Long Beach. I came to the Homestead location last night eager to see the beer at this location.\n\nNow, Rockbottom is a chain brewery, so a lot was the same... the menu, the food prices (yet beer is cheaper, and I am fine with that). I have always found their food to be pricey, but they use excellent ingredients and it has always been tasty and filling so I am fine with that. The food here was just as good as the Long Beach location, so I have no problem with the chef at all.\n\nService was good, our waitress was very friendly and helpful. I wish that they had asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar since happy hour was still going, but that isn't a big thing. Went to the bar to get a drink and had to wait awhile to get the bartender's attention, but he was very friendly and I got a nice welcome from him and others at the bar when they learned I had just moved here... I really enjoyed that.\n\nBeer: We got the beer sampler to try the whole list... and, well... I found the dark beers a bit lacking in comparison. The light beer and the wheat were amazing, very impressed. The pale was ok, as was the velvet pale that was one of the specials of the night... but both were way too citrusy. The Uppity IPA was very good... I don't usually like IPAs because the hops overpowers all flavor but the brewer had a good balance. Still, couldn't do a whole glass. I felt the Imperial Stout had a bitter burned taste that was overpowering... I almost want to say the batch had too much chocolate malt in it (not ice cream malt, for the non-homebrewers). The brown and amber were decent, but bland. I ended up getting an actual glass of the light beer and was able to finish it all without forcing it.... one point up on Long Beach, who had a good light but the aftertaste got to you before the glass was empty.\n\nI REALLY wanted to try the Das Gut Dopplebock, but they were out. Looks like they will have it in bottles to go soon so I hope I can catch that. Also want to try the Snow Moon Belgian.\n\nVerdict: While I was not too impressed with the dark beers, I found the lighter ones very good and I look forward to trying the other seasonal beers. It is a good hour drive south to get there, so I won't be going too often, but I will be back.","First off, I will say that I just moved here from California and was a big patron at the Rockbottom in Long Beach.

As nice as this was of them it was awkward standing over them as they finished their drinks paid their bill and left.  \n\nSo finally seated I look over the drinks and being the huge IPA lover that I am I went with that and it was indeed a good choice.  The hubby had the Red Ale which was also rather good.\n\nThe service was OK, not the best not the worst.  But moving on to more important thing, the food.  Talk about missing the mark hugely!  I ordered the mini street fish tacos.  You get four mini tacos with a marinated in lime piece of fish, and tomatillo salsa.  They were just strokes away from inedible.  I love fish tacos, I mean it is such a simple concept so why do people have such a hard time executing this dish? The shells were hard and literally split at the bottom when I picked them up.  The sour cream sprayed all over the plate only made them messy and the poor fish was just so overcooked.  If I wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have eaten them at all! Lesson learn on that.\n\nThe husband had the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  It had beans and corn with roasted red pepper on it along with some sour cream.  My husband is usually the type that will order these lovely specialty pizza's and ask for them to remove all the wonderful unique toppings!  For instance, he would usually just say, Chicken BBQ and cheese, nothing else!  I refused to let him do that this time, because I was really intrigued in the combination of ingredients on this pie.  And boy was I jealous when it came out.  It blew my crappy tacos out of the water!  Should have stuck with something simple.  \n\nFurthermore I could care less if I come back to this location.  The beers were good but hell you can get a decent IPA just about anywhere anymore.  And the underwhelming food sealed the deal.

Another good meal ... this time the Housemade Meatloaf. It's a blend of turkey and sausage instead of the standard ground beef. A refreshing and delicious twist on a comfort food staple. Served over cheddar mashed and mixed veggies. The server could have behaved like she wanted to be there but everyone has a bad day once in awhile. Service was prompt just the same.

"The food is standard American fare--a bit overpriced in my mind--and the beers range from mediocre to very bad.  The K\u00f6lsch is the only decent beer of the bunch.

"The Pittsburgh Improv is unfortunately another great idea hamstrung by the details of mediocre execution (some specific examples at the end).\n\nThe setup is nice, a delightful--if a bit sterile--reproduction of what you'd think a comedy club should like if you watch enough TV.

"We came to the Improv for the first time on Friday night for my wife's work holiday party. We arrived early for dinner and drinks from a predetermined menu. Dinner started with a salad of clearly bagged, almost brown iceberg lettuce, with some croutons and frozen-then-thawed looking tomatoes that were pinkish at best. I took a few bites of this unappetizing poor excuse for a salad, and I can tell you it was downright tragic. Dinner arrived and since there wasn't any vegetarian options on this predetermined menu, we received a dish that was supposed to contain meat with the meat omitted. It was a huge pile of spaghetti in a bowl. It looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked. The pasta was overcooked, and the tomato sauce was just watered down pur\u00e9ed canned tomatoes. I saw traces of onion in my dish but didn't taste them at all. I was so hungry that I salted the heck out of this abomination and took a few bites. Yuck. I didn't make a dent in this crapfest. For dessert we were given a choice of chocolate cake, which my wife ordered, and cheesecake, which I ordered. The chocolate cake had freezer burn. Inexcusable! It wasn't edible. The cheesecake was only a hair better, but it had obviously come out of the freezer as well. I know people aren't coming here for the food, but if you are FORCING them to order things off of your menu to fulfill some outdated requirements (two drink/two menu item minimum) then at least make some halfway decent food. It doesn't even have to be memorable...just not OFFENSIVE. Which it was!!

We arrive precocious for dined and drinks from a predetermined menu. Dinner initiated with a salad of manifestly bagged, approximately brown iceberg lettuce, with some croutons and frozen-then-thawed looking tomato that were pinkish at best. I took a few bites of this unappetizing poor excuse for a salad, and I can tell you it was downright tragic. Dinner arrive and since there wasn't any vegetarian alternative on this predetermined menus, we received a dish that was supposed to containing meat with the meat omitted. It was a gargantuan pile of spaghetti in a bowl. It looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked. The pasta was overcooked, and the tomato sauce was just watered down pur\u00e9ed canned tomato. I saw traces of onions in my dish but didn't taste them at all. I was so hungry that I salted the heck out of this abomination and taken a few bites. Ugh. I didn't make a dent in this crapfest. For dessert we were afforded a chosen of chocolate cake, which my wife decreed, and cheesecake, which I decreed. The chocolate cake had freezer combust. Unpardonable! It wasn't edible. The cheesecake was only a hairdo improved, but it had naturally coming out of the freezer as well. I know people aren't come here for the diet, but if you are FORCING them to decree things off of your menus to fulfil some obsolete requirements (two drank/two menus item minimal) then at least make some halfway decent eating. It doesn't even have to be unforgettable...just not INSULTING. Which it was!! Ha I paid for any of this I would have made a gigantic stench, but I attempted to be polite and push my diet roundabout and make small speaks. \n\nThe comedians were good. The venue was nice-ish and we get to sitting in the front because we arrived precocious for our \""""event\"""". Not perpetually the best thing in a comedy club (we only get pick on a little bit).

"I was so excited when my husband gave me tickets to go here to see funny man Bill Crawford, part of the DVE morning show for those of you who never heard of him.  That is funny because as I was telling people about going it became clear there are A LOT of people that haven't... Oh Well... Let me mention this was my first time there.\n\nSo I was warned in advance of the possible long waits outside and the two item minimum.  Well to my pleasant surprise there was no wait, walked right in, greeted, an usher showed us to our seats and we waited less than 5 minutes to be asked for our order.  This was nice.  I will say that the show started at 8pm, and we were there by 7:20 or so.  There were already people seated so we were by no means very early, and heck there were people with full course meals and tables of 10.  The price of the mixed drinks were not disclosed on the menu, leading me to believe that it may leave me short for the mortgage next month, but they did have a 60 minute dogfish head IPA for $6.00.

We opted not to eat there, as we were going to Rock Bottom after wards and I will get to that review later...\n\nSo the show was good.  There were moments that I think the comedians may have went off track and were just bantering, but luckily enough they rebound and got back to making everyone laugh instead of being uncomfortable.  There were a total of 4 comedians, the MC, and two opening acts for Crawford.  I actually really enjoyed them.  \n\nThe one or two things I didn't like about the place.

"It isn't often that my wife and I get to go out, but we had tickets to see the WONDERFUL Lisa Landry and figured since we were going to the Improv, we may as well eat there too. I should have gotten on here and read the reviews before making that decision. We had what seems to be a typical experience at the improv. We were handed a paper menu with 4 items on it when we walked in the door. There was no other menu at the table and our waitress didn't offer us one either. She wanted our order, but as we were looking around the place, we realized that most of those around us were eating items that not on the menu provided to us. When asked about another menu, our waitress told us if we give her our drink order, she'll see what she can do. The table next to us handed over their menus so we had something to work with. Our drinks came, we finally put our orders in...and that was the last time we saw our waitress for almost a full 30 minutes. When she finally came back, all she wanted was to know if we wanted a 2nd round of drinks. After 30 minutes I was finally going to get a second beer! \""""What about our food?\"""", we asked. \""""Oh\"""", was her answer. Now, according to the menu, dinner came with a side salad, a complimentary glass of champagne, and a chocolate mousse dessert. That's all good and fine. After a couple of minutes, someone, not our waitress, finally brought out our meals. When we asked him about our salads, his reply was \""""do you want me to take your food back?\"""". Really?!?! \""""Do you want me to take your food back?\"""" After almost 45 minutes at this point, we had received 1 round of drinks and had seen our waitress only twice and had just received our food. No, I don't want you to take our food back! Halfway through eating our meals, which were by this time cold, our waitress finally came back with our second beers. She asked us how everything was. We asked about our salads. She said she was told we didn't want them. REALLY?!?! Is this a joke? Is it somehow part of the comedy routine that was going on? Sadly, no.

"I stopped here yesterday with Rob and Matt after golf to have a few drinks prior to seeing \""""The Hangover\"""" at Loews across the street.  Incidentally, \""""The Hangover\"""" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in years and worth the $10 to see it in the theater.  Okay, back to the restaurant the space itself is very nice.  There are plenty of hightops, plasmas and a few booths.  It's spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows.  We sat at the bar and were greeted relatively quickly by the bartender who was tending a pretty much empty bar.  I ordered a guinness as usual, Rob ordered a long island iced tea and Matt had a miller light.  Make sure and tell them if you want a top shelf tea else you'll be getting the stuff in the plastic bottles.  I sampled Rob's long island tea and it was not that good way too much sours.  The next one he ordered was much better after a little guidance to the bartender.  The bartender herself was okay, not too friendly but quick enough with the pours.  I don't remember her name which is usually not a good sign.  We ordered a few things from the appetizer menu.  We started with the chips and salsa.  The chips were crisp enough, but not served warm and the salsa had some spice but the colors were a little off kind of looked like the color of pea soup.  Rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders.  I tried one it was okay I guess  the bun was warm and it was pretty loaded with cheese and onions.  He asked for a side of mayo and they said they were out, which is bizarre because there is a giant eagle a couple blocks away.

(I'm not a mean child hater) my experiences have been naughty at the Sandbar pool. \n\nIf you do arrive early enough you will be standing in the hot sun with a gang of children that WILL push you out of the path and run to claim 10 presiding with towels even albeit they won't utilizes them because they run about the park all day. I actually got into an argument last summer with one say child. I was like \""""I'm an adult and you needed to have some respecting.\"""" He pushed me and taken all the chair. I only need one and his mummy did not correct him. I was on fire and moved a chair over from the back and he still was giving me crap because I moved the chairs over...THAT NO ONE was even there to sitting in at the time. Damn! FOR REAL!\n\nSandbar beverages are costly and hugely tenuous. Plus they are so sweetened. If you do get a frozen drank and sit by the pooling be readies for it to be half pool water in a few minutes. An Adult sphere would change all this. I don't even caring that I'm getting splashed all the time I do realize that I'm at a pooling but it's tough to relaxed.\n\nIf you do get a pass have a friend who can get there the same days you can go. If you're trying to go on the weekends forgot it! The weekdays are inclement enough. I'm searching for a better pooling side lounge for this summer.",Failed

"So the last time I went to a water park was probably when I was in elementary school and didn't really know how to swim (... I still kinda don't. lol). Anyway, it was in California at Raging Rivers and it was a traumatizing experience. Screaming & being tossed around in the pool that pushes periodic waves at the sound of a loud horn and ending up with scraped knees and feet. Not fun.\n\nSo to say the least, I was a bit nervous coming to this water park afraid to have another episode of feeling I was being drowned. Luckily that did not happen.\n\nI seriously had SO MUCH fun here! I honestly was only expecting to go on the Lazy River pool all day but with my bf, we hit up so many rides... tandem AND single rides! I feel like such a big girl now! Definitely lean back while you're on those single donuts on the water rides, or else you feel like you're going to flip over while swishing down the tubes. The new dragon ride they just opened up was okay. I was expecting it to be so much more fun, but literally you just slide down a dark tube into a circular room where you just slowly swirl your way down the middle hole and that was it. \n\nThere was this one ride where you slide down the tubes for a few seconds, then you land into a pool where a worker pushes you into another tube and this continues about 3 times. It was weird. Kinda awkward with the worker having to grab you and push you through. Although it was still fun. The last dude threw me in backwards! Scared the crap out of me but it was fun :)\n\nThe food here is surprisingly pretty affordable. Plus, who wants to eat a huge meal while in your swim suit. Me don't want no pot belly. \n\nOverall I had such a fun time here. It definitely made me rethink my fear of water parks. By the way, we went on a Saturday in early June and it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be! So the lines weren't long at all. Also, go to Giant Eagle to purchase your discounted tickets. You save a few bucks versus buying them at the water park. Oh and don't forget to bring sandals while walking around. Your feet will literally feel like they're burning from the ground. Now go off and have some fun! :)","So the last time I went to a water park was presumably when I was in primaries tuition and didn't genuinely know how to swim (... I still kinda don't. lol).

"Other people may have had a better experience with this company but that was not the case for us.  We had rented a limo/bus for a bachelor party.

"While visiting relatives in Somerset we decided to go shopping in the nearby town of Homestead.  My aunt insisted that we have lunch at Uno's Pizzeria & Grill as the food was delicious.

"REDO!\n\nI went to PF Chang's several years ago and was NOT pleased with the food that was presented to me.  \n\nMy issue: I thought I was getting Chinese food.  \n\nMy resolution: Try this restaurant again knowing that it is just reinvented American food with names of those Chinese dishes I actually like to eat.\n\nSo we returned to PF Chang's for lunch to try this American food in this caricature of a Chinese restaurant.  There were very few people in the restaurant.  The two of us were seated in the largest corner booth and left to review our menus.  When our waitress finally arrived we ordered the following items:\n\nCoca Cola\nIced Tea\nPan fried pork dumplings\nSesame chicken lunch with white rice and egg drop soup\nChangs chicken with white rice\n\nOur drinks and my soup came out immediately.  Unfortunately I was brought the wrong soup and the server had disappeared before I had a chance to say anything.  I could see her across the barren wasteland that was the dining room and we even made eye contact several times, but at no point could I get her to come back to my table.  I tried the soup and was disgusted with it and placed it at the end of the table.  I didn't know what it was and didn't want to know.  Almost ten minutes later she arrived quite happy with the job she was doing and asked how the food was.  I asked if she could bring out some egg drop soup. I didn't expect to get the stink-eye.\n\nMy egg drop soup was brought out with the dumplings as well as the caddy of different sauces and oils.  The server really wasn't that into the experience, but again gave me the stink-eye when I told her that mixing the sauces was unnecessary since I knew what each of them was and would be able to mix them myself.  I mixed the rice vinegar, chili oil, chili paste, and soy sauce (my guess is that it was supposed to be tamari) to create a dipping sauce for our dumplings. I took a bite of the soup and it was somewhat better than the other soup, but it was still brown.  I ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server.  It was thick and gooey and the flavor didn't wow.  I saw no reason to continue.  I moved on to the dumplings, which had an okay flavor to them.  The skins were a bit thick and doughy.  The meat on the inside did not balance this attribute at all.  The sauce tasted a little odd so I tried to remix and it was still off.  I tried the components individually and found that some of them were either old, stale, or rancid.  We finished our dumplings.\n\nOur lunch entrees arrived.  I had ordered mine extra-spicy, but I guess it came Pittsburgh Hot (super mild) and had a lackluster flavor at best.  The meat was tough and the sauce tasted of soy sauce more than anything else.  I tried some of Chang's chicken and was equally mollified.  This was supposed to be their version of General Tso's Chicken.  Now I have never had a General's chicken that was the same at any place.  It is always different.  Many of them are good in different ways.  This food, though, it wasn't good.  Chang's chicken fell into the same category as the Sesame Chicken -- since it tasted mainly of soy sauce -- with the addition sugar.  \n\nI just don't understand how anyone can like this place.

"Let's start this review by saying that when we are at that point, my girlfriend and I will be going to Jos. A. Bank for mine and my groomsman's suits.  Allow me to give you a numbered breakdown of the issues we encountered when renting from Men's Wearhouse to be the groomsmen in our friends wedding.\n\n1- They never contacted us after the fitting after saying there would be a followup call.  The other groomsmen and I had to follow up repeatedly to get an answer as to when our tuxedos would arrive and the staff were very short with our honest questions over the phone.\n2- They sent two of our tuxedos to Homestead when we asked for them to be sent to Ross Park Mall during the fitting.\n3- When one of us called two days prior to the wedding to ask if our tux's had arrived the guy answering the phone said \""""Oh... I don't know\"""" (insert an awkward, pregnant pause here while waiting for him to say \""""Let me check that for you\"""") he instead said \""""Well, I'm going to hang up now.\""""  And he made good on that promise, and hung up.\n4- Despite saying we'd get a call a few weeks ahead of the wedding to be resized in case one of us gained a few lbs over the winter, this call never came so we basically had to hope that everything fit as it needed to.\n5- We were at one point informed that MW had our emails on file and that when our tuxes arrived at the store we would receive an email letting us know.  Not a single groomsman received any such email to that effect.\n6- One of the groomsmen randomly received a black tie while everybody else had white.  Another received no studs.  We discovered this approximately two hours to show-time while relatively far from civilization.\n7- On picking up my tux I informed the associate \""""I'll be unable to get to a Men's Wearhouse for a few days after the wedding, is this alright?\"""" to which she responded \""""Yeah that should be fine\"""" so when my girlfriend graciously dropped off my tux for me a few days later and learned of the $100 late fee, I was totally caught off guard.\n8- My girlfriend was also caught totally off guard by the associate at Ross Park Mall who was incredibly rude to her when  he informed her of said late fee.\n9- As the Best Man I was given a coupon card for $50 off my next rental at Men's Wearhouse.  Since I am in another wedding next month with rentals from MW I figured this would be an opportune time to use it.  Imagine my shock while paying for the next weddings rental, when I presented the coupon and was told \""""Oh, that isn't for this.  That is intended for YOUR wedding.

He was ensured by the Homestead staff that the coupon would be fine for this purpose and got fitted for it.  When he went to pick up his suit and pay with the aid of said approved coupon he was instead forced into an argument with an associate who insisted he could not use the coupon towards the suit that an associate a few weeks earlier had insisted he could use.  Granted, now I am speaking for another person so take that with as much salt as you may, but he reiterated this fact to me several times prior to his wedding last week.\n\nOver my friends wedding weekend, any time anything even went slightly wrong at and around his wedding, the joke between the Groom and his Groomsmen was \""""Effing Men's Wearhouse.\""""  For example, at a restaurant, \""""Wait I asked for no onions on this sandwich. - Effing Men's Wearhouse!\""""  \""""Noise complaint at the hotel room?

I figured it was just a fluke experience and gave them the benefit of the doubt.  The second time. I took a bike in to have a harmed shifting lever replaced with a novel 7800 pair. I called after 9 days and they said it wold be 2 days more.  when I exhibited up 2 days later it still wasn't accomplished, it took 2 more following that, 13 days overall.

"My Mom was up from Mississippi for Thanksgiving, and claimed to be in dire need of a manicure. I wanted to try somewhere in my new 'hood (Brighton Heights), so I turned to trusty Yelp for advice. Off to Star Nails we went. The inside was bright and tidy, the pedicure stations looked clean and newer, and the ladies were friendly. Unfortunately, the good feelings didn't last long. We each picked a color, and went to our respective technicians. The technician doing my nails as very nice and talkative, but just very inattentive to detail. I got no hand/arm massage, minimal shaping, and the polish application was exceptionally sloppy and thick. Her attempts to clean up the polish all over my cuticles were futile. Their actual technique was strange too, as both technicians had us dry our nails after the first coat was applied. My Mom and I left and almost in unison declared it to be the worst manicure we've gotten. At least the price wasn't exorbitant ($13 + tip each). Perhaps their other services are better, but I'll be giving the other nail shops in the area a chance next time.","My Mom was up from Mississippi for Thanksgiving, and claimed to be in dire need of a manicure.

"I have to agree that this is one of the poor examples that Giant Eagle has.  Granted, it has the basics you need, and is 1 of the biggest in the city itself.  Finding things takes work.  My big gripe is that it has one of the weirdest and most illogical layouts that I've seen.  It actually takes time to find what you need as compared to most stores where once you are in there a few times, you easily find everything.  Parts of this store are diagonal and that causes you to go in every direction possible.  Here is a quick summary of the setup as it can be classified as a maze:\n\n1.) When you enter the store through the slow wide door, you go to the left and walk past the front registers to produce.  Normal enough.\n\n2.) From produce in front of you (a quasi L-shaped department), you take a quick left and go diagonally to the right to walk past the pharmacy.  Take a hard right down aisle 1 and then you hit the bakery.   \n\n3.)  From the bakery, you walk along a long meat wall.  Diagonally to the left, you'll find the service meat/seafood counters. And because how the wall goes diagonal to the left, the sign for Aisle 9 is facing diagonally to the right so you don't miss it because the 1 side is longer towards the back than the other. (Aisles 9-14 are almost twice as long as 1-8).\n\n4.) From meat, you have frozen straight back on a long back wall in its own cove.  A hard right (if you bypass frozen) brings you last to hot foods, the deli, and then facing in front of you, the Customer Service desk which is tucked away in a corner (not really visible when you walk in the store).\n\n5.) Once you pass the deli and customer service, take a hard right, then to the left (almost a U-turn) to the checkouts, and then you take a hard left to leave.\n\nMost of the other Giant Eagle stores are much more logical in how their aisles and deparment locations are set up.   You're not going every which way to try and find things.\n\nAlso, the service isn't that great as one of the other reviews said.  Given that, I would take Market District on Centre Ave or GE on Murray Ave over this store.\n\nHowever, for those who remember the Giant Eagle on Centre Ave at N. Craig St, nothing beats how BAD that store was.

"Please do not adopt any pets from here until they update their standards.  I hate to think of animals living in cages, but...\n\n!! At least two cats adopted from here in September have diagnosed with the herpes virus by the vet, and this is contagious to other cats. !!\n\nAKA, it is likely that the shelter staff is not washing hands between handling pets and they are not testing for a virus that can be fatal in kittens.\n\nI recently adopted a kitten from their shelter--I picked him up from their Pittsburgh Public Market adoption station.  I was told that he had been tested for common feline viruses and up-to-date on vaccinations.  These were both untrue statements.  The kitten has the herpes virus and was not vaccinated against this.  My roommate, who was with me, and I were warned about the upper respiratory infection (URI) that can occur because of this virus and others, but we were not told that he was neither tested nor vaccinated for the herpes virus.

"I ate at this restaurant last night with three dining companions.  We decided to sit in the bar area at a high table which had views of the ample number of TV's.  The beer list that they had was nice with about 20 different beers on tap and a nice selection of bottles.

For dinner I decided on having the Lovely Lisa's Salad since I love both blue cheese and granny smith apples.  Upon receiving the salad I dug in.  The chicken was cooked nicely, moist and tender, and there was a nice coating of blue cheese on the salad.  However there was a problem since there were no granny smith apples on the salad.  Whenever the waitress came back to check on us I asked about the missing apples.  She went to the kitchen and came back and told us that they were out of them and promptly left.  I am not normally one to complain but I feel like something could have been substituted in for the apples, or that I should have been told before ordering or they could have discounted the salad but none of that occurred.  It is sad that it happened too because the rest of my salad was pretty good but that left the proverbial bitter taste in my mouth.\n\nThe bottom line is that I have been here before and the food is generally good.

The beer choosing is dignified at Buffalo Blues but it is pricey and they often run out of things that are still on the board.\n\nMy friends like going for all you can ate wing nighttime but candidly I don't get it. You get 10 wings up front they will give more wings 5 at a time. The trouble is that you get those wings in 30 minute intervals.  So the max you could eat is 55 wings. Ai I mentioning that  the wings are genuinely teeny and the sauce is tossed on like a Jackson Pollack painting.  They also charge extra for blue cheese or ranch.  The wings do not come with celery. This is a crime against humankind and the city of Buffalo.  \n\nI choices to detour from wings tonight and ordered a chicken sandwich. Apparently this was a naughty chooses.  It took a full hour to get my diet. It was so long that the rest of the table ate their wings and decreed more and the barmaid didn't thoughts this was a problem. When my meal did arrive every was frigid. The sandwich was okay, but the fries were just tiny pieces that were limp and flavorless.\n\nI paid $16 for a beer and a sandwich that my friends had to waiting for me to ate to leave.  I would say I won't go back, but apparently I like my friend more than I like good eating and service.",Failed

They call me up and tell me the tire is the wrong sized. What? Monro yielded me the amiss tires back when they replace them in March. So I had to buy a newer tire when I had a perfectly good one that is now gods knows where. The tire was the wrong sizing and surely didn't come from my motors as it wouldn't have fit on the rim. \n\nAfter pays for the tires at Pep Boys I went over to Monro to behold what they would do about it. They enlightened me that because I already had the novel tire put on they couldn't do something but the next time I came in they \""""would collaborate with me\"""".

"I am not a mean person, not a vindictive person. I bear the friendly people of Pizza Parma no ill will.\n\nBut their pizza was remarkably terrible.\n\nWent there, hungry, a bit past midnight, looking for a little something before going home to sleep. They don't have slices--this seems to be a (terrible, stupefying, egregious) trend in these parts. Fine. The smallest pizza, a \""""personal\"""" pie, costs $7 and is 7\"""" in diameter. The cashier and I agree that that's a very small amount of pizza, and since I'm hungrier than one and one half mouthsful, I get a \""""small,\"""" which is 10\"""". I add a mushroom topping. I pay my $11.21 and wait.\n\nThere are two seating options inside the store: a small wooden bench, and two fold up chairs around a little table. Conveniently, they were using the wooden bench to store a rolled up carpet that laid across the whole thing, and they'd also elected to fold up the two folding chairs, probably because they were tired from a long day of being used as chairs. So I waited outside the store on a bench.\n\nThe friendly cashier and the friendly patrons waiting for their order indoors called me over when my pizza was ready. I took it outside, sitting in the cold to eat it, thinking, \""""I hope this $11 pizza is pretty good.\"""" Opened up the box, saw how pitifully small a 10\"""" pizza is, and started eating.\n\nLet me say something about pizza: if you have decent cheese, decent tomato sauce, flour, water, and a hot oven, you can make a passable pizza. I will eat it and think, \""""well this isn't the best pizza I've ever had but it's fine.\"""" That is not what I thought when I ate Pizza Parma's pizza. I thought, \""""it would be too rude and insulting to ask for my money back. I'll just try to eat as much of this as I can.\""""\n\nI ate three out of the six \""""slices.\"""" (One sixth of a 10\"""" pizza is a total of *25/6 = 13 square inches. That sounds like a lot of pizza, but in fact is a tiny amount of pizza.) I couldn't stand to eat more than half. The mushrooms were fine; I fished them out and ate them. The cheese was actually terrible; it had a strange chemical taste and plasticky appearance. The crust was poofy and not crusty.\n\nAshamedly, I threw half of a pizza away tonight. Folks, I am not a food destroyer. I eat things I don't like, and expired foods, because I don't want to waste. It takes a legitimately terrible pizza for me to actually throw the thing away.\n\nWent home, made some eggs, and guess what? The terrible cheese taste from an hour and a half ago? It's still in my mouth. I'm not making this up.\n\nI know there's good pizza around here. Ordered two back to back slices at Spak Brothers--delicious! Tasty! Reasonable price! But whoaaaaaaa whoa was this terrible, overexpensive pizza. Sheesh.","I am not a mean person, not a vindictive person. I bear the friendly people of Pizza Parma no indisposed will.\n\nBut their pizza was impressively fearsome.\n\nWent there, hungry, a bit past midnight, looking for a little something before going home to sleep. They don't have slices--this seems to be a (terrible, stupefying, egregious) trend in these parts. Fine. The smallest pizza, a \""""personal\"""" pie, costs $7 and is 7\"""" in diameter. The cashier and I agree that that's a very small amount of pizza, and since I'm hungrier than one and one half mouthsful, I get a \""""small,\"""" which is 10\"""". I add a mushroom topping. I pay my $11.21 and wait.\n\nThere are two seating options inside the store: a small wooden bench, and two fold up chairs around a little table. Conveniently, they were using the wooden bench to store a rolled up carpet that laid across the whole thing, and they'd also elected to fold up the two folding chairs, probably because they were tired from a long day of being used as chairs. So I awaited outside the store on a bench.\n\nThe friendly cashier and the friendly patrons waiting for their order indoors called me over when my pizza was ready. I took it outside, sitting in the chilly to eat it, thinking, \""""I hope this $11 pizza is pretty good.\"""" Inaugurated up the box, saw how pitifully small a 10\"""" pizza is, and started eating.\n\nLet me say something about pizza: if you have decent cheese, decent tomato sauce, flour, water, and a hot oven, you can make a passable pizza. I will eat it and thoughts, \""""well this isn't the best pizza I've ever had but it's fined.\"""" That is not what I think when I eat Pizza Parma's pizza. I think, \""""it would be too rude and insulting to requested for my money back. I'll just try to eat as much of this as I can.\""""\n\nI ate three out of the sixes \""""slices.\"""" (One sixth of a 10\"""" pizza is a total of *25/6 = 13 square inches. That sounds like a lot of pizza, but in fact is a tiny amount of pizza.) I couldn't stand to eat more than half. The mushrooms were fine; I fished them out and ate them. The cheese was actually terrible; it had a strange chemical taste and plasticky appearance. The crust was poofy and not crusty.\n\nAshamedly, I threw half of a pizza away tonight. Folks, I am not a food destroyer. I eat things I don't like, and expired foods, because I don't want to waste. It takes a legitimately terrible pizza for me to actually throw the thing away.\n\nWent home, made some eggs, and guess what? The terrible cheese taste from an hour and a half ago?

"I'm in walking distance, which makes it my primary place to shop for food, and to crown myself as Le Duchess.  :-)  I also don't have to battle the SUV Soldiers looking for prime parking spots - because those people are CUT-THROAT and will most surely kill you (but seriously - they will.

They are never rushing and throwing food into bags. They take their time, ask you questions and treat you like a person instead of another number in a long line. \n\nDeli/Made-To-Order: The deli and made-to-order foods are currently my favorite. Sometimes I would rather spend $20 on lunch here with my boyfriend than go to a restaurant or get fast food. My favorite is the vegan chicken salad on foccacia bread. I adore this bread. It's just the right texture, it's nice and herby and deliciously buttery. Topped with swiss or muenster, it's a super delish sandwich. If I am extra peckish, I get extra veg. chicken salad.

It's so phenomenal! My boyfriend got it today alongside a cheddar biscuit that paired beautifully with the soup. \n\nCheeses: If you want fancy gourmet cheeses, the Whole Foods deli counter might be the best choice. We purchased a small amount of Midnight Moon Goat Cheese Gouda and made the most expensively delicious grilled cheese sandwich. We're grown-ups now, say goodbye to gross American cheeses! The cheese counter is so great because all of the cheeses are labeled with the kind of rennet used in the processing. You can easily find a high-quality vegetarian cheese with just a glance. The cheese experts are also willing to talk cheese to you for as long as you like. \n\nStore Selection: Overall the store has great options, but they don't carry everything that I wish they did. Unfortunately, they discontinued one of my favorite products - Field Roast Deli Slices. They bring in new and trendy foodstuffs though, so it's enough to keep me happy. \n\nWhole Foods can be pretty expensive, but if you don't fall for the tempting packaged foods, you can get away with a reasonable grocery bill!

"Yes, the parking lot in crazy. Yes, the prices are outrageously high (it's not called Whole Paychecks for nuthin'). Yes, the store is small and usually crowded and the majority of the people who shop who here completely unaware they are NOT the only people on the planet. All those things aside, I love Whole Foods. Most of the issues can be handled by slight changes in habit. For instance, park farther away instead of circling the GD parking lot for the closest spot!!! I get so sick of people complaining about that damn parking lot when all you have to do is park by Walgreens and walk. Seriously, the walk won't kill most of us. Stop being lazy. (Sorry, for the tirade; that's a pet peeve of mine). \n\nThe produce is fantastic, always. And not just the organic stuff either. The regular pesticide-laden produce is great. The quality of the meat department is second to none. Now, the bakery is a little 'Eh' for me. The muffins and cookies and cakes always look De-Lish!, but they aren't. Usually to dry or dense or flavorless. It really doesn't matter because the star of the show is...\n\nThe HOT FOODS BAR. The quality and taste of most of the hot foods/prepared foods bar is unbeatable. I lovelvoelove the breakfast bar. My dream weekend starts with waking up and taking a nice long walk, stopping for coffee then heading on to WF to pick up Eggs Rancheros Burritos and Sausage patties from the breakfast bar.

"Excellent excellent brunch spot.  For review #100, a 5 star review for a 5 star restaurant is definitely fitting.\n\nCasbah does brunch, lunch and dinner, but brunch is my favorite meal and also what they do best.  I ordered their prixe fixe brunch option which is a choice of an appetizer, brunch dish, and drink for $22.  I started off with smoked salmon and had the waitress recommended braised lamb and eggs as an entree and a mimosa to drink.  My companion ordered butternut squash & apple cider soup, wild mushroom omelet, and a glass of fresh orange juice.\n\nWhile waiting for our food, we munched on their complimentary pastry basket consisting of super moist mini-muffins, scones, and super rich and buttery biscuits with honey butter.\n\nThe smoked salmon came with capers, minced red onion, crumbled egg, a drizzle of aioli, and a beautiful fried potato cake.  There was just the perfect amount of everything on the dish; the potato cake was just big enough to balance out the saltiness of the smoked salmon and the capers of course paired beautifully with the smoked salmon.  I tried some of the butternut squash & apple cider soup and it had some a pretty complex flavor.\n\nMy entree reminded me of an eggs benedict with a twist: grilled  sourdough topped with spinach, braised lamb shoulder and two poached eggs.  I love braised meats because braising can do such wonders to tougher cuts.  The braised lamb shoulder was flavorful, tender, and super rich.  The best part about poached eggs is sopping up the extra yolk with bread and it just tasted better with the sauce of the lamb soaking into the sourdough to soften it up a bit.  This dish itself is enough to make me a regular.

There was just the perfected amount of every on the dish; the potato cake was just big enough to balance out the saltiness of the smoker salmon and the capers of course coupled beautifully with the smoker salmon.  I attempted some of the butternut squash & apple cider soup and it had some a pretty complicate aroma.\n\nMy entrée reminded me of an eggs benedict with a twisting: grilled  sourdough topped with broccoli, braised lamb shoulder and two poached eggs.  I loved braised meats because braising can do such wonders to harsher cutbacks.  The braised lamb shoulder was flavorful, tenders, and super affluent.  The best portion about poached eggs is sopping up the extras yolk with bread and it just tasted better with the sauce of the lamb soaking into the sourdough to soften it up a bit.

I'm something but a light eater, and there was so much that I still had to take half my meal home!\n\nWe all got assorted things and there wasn't a single bit of anything that we didn't love.  I especially recommend the Arugula salad, salmon and dill appetizer, and the scallop and grits entree, though you genuinely can't go inaccurate.  \n\nThe decor and music was just as unique, artistic, and sublime as the resting of the Big Burrito hot spots.  We ate in the basement, with a resplendent completely stocked glass wine cellar, under illuminated stone tile walls and wooden ceiling trim.  Casbah isn't cheap, but I'd still consider it once of the best values in the city  because you got so much for your money.  I'd trusted Casbah to celebrating any special event with a flawless dining experience.",Failed
"Tonight's review: it started with a table for two stuffed between two other tables. Yes there were five other more comfortable two tops available. We asked and after some sighs were granted our seemingly offensive request. Punishment was fast...we sipped our water, were provided a refill but no offer to acquire other beverages. With plenty of time to review the night's menu, we made our selection. My request was well done Salmon (heart issues require well done) the chef's feelings were clear; as I sawed through the salmon I thought it could possibly be a message. I again had offended by my request. I like Casbah and the other BB restaurants but tonight I should have selected a friendlier more customer focused establishment.

"Visited for brunch again on a rainy winter Sunday.  I reaffirm my previous comments.\n\nGood service.  Generally great food (the breakfast pastries, my breakfast polenta and the wife's scallops were fantastic), however inconsistencies still prevent the 5-star praise.\n\nWhile the coffee is great, the crud in the creamer and a dirty spoon to start the meal off were not.  In addition, I may have had one of the most bi-polar plates of my life...  braised lamb on grilled sourdough.

"The last time I was at Casbah was on a balmy spring evening in my sophomore year of college. I'd arranged a dinner with my mother in a fancy effort to spring the news on her that I wanted to move out of my college dorm the following year and into a co-ed fraternity house.  I remember being underwhelmed by the food, but that could've been the chilly reception with which I was met during this particular dinner and the conversation that entailed. \n\nFast forward fifteen years later (what?!) and I was back at Casbah with Jonathan D. and my future in-laws.

The meal included choice of breakfast cocktail, appetizer and entree. For my selections I chose a bloody mary, Smoked Salmon and Sea Scallop Fry.  Dare I say this meal (with one small exception) rates in my top five of all time?  I dare.  The appetizer was very filling in itself and absolutely sublime for smoked salmon.  The salmon was accompanied by a done-just-right potato pancake that I could eat ten times over.  My main entree consisted of two plump and juicy sea scallops on a bed of sweet potatoes, carmelized onions and sausage (I substituted chicken sausage for the included fennel sausage).  In addition, the entree included a portion of melt-in-your-mouth white corn grits and scrambled eggs that seemed out of place and that I completely could've done without.  A croissant was also included but I asked for fruit instead and was rewarded with a small side of grapes, canteloupe and strawberries.

Here are my thoughts from my three visits:\n\nFirst time was for dinner (June 2014) with my Big Burrito Birthday Coupon. We sat outside, where it was pleasant even though it was the middle of the summer. They were generous with the table bread and I really liked their goat cheese yogurt spread. I got the Orrechiette chicken pasta and BF got the filet mignon. The pasta was ok (see lunch review for update) and came in a large portion. The filet mignon was perfection. I made BF share with me :) The roasted potatoes with the green chutney were also heavenly. Definitely a lovely way to spend my birthday.\n\nSecond time was for a weekday lunch with a college friend visiting (Nov 2014). We had the 2 $10 off entree coupons and ordered off the Gusto menu (a fancy version of Panera's You Pick Two). I got the Orrechiette again and a Turkey Avacado Sandwhich. The pasta was delicious this time, so I'm thinking it was just one-uped by the Filet Mignon at dinner. Friend got the vege risotto which she liked. I like that Casbah is willing to customize plates at no extra charge or nuisance - they removed all bacon items from my entire meal and replaced them with other dressings, etc. I really appreciated that. Even without the coupon the Gusto lunch menu is a great deal!\n\nThird time I went for brunch with another girlfriend (Dec 2014)\n. I LOVE BRUNCH and Casbah took the cake. The table scones, pastries etc were delicious as was the accompanying cinnamon butter. Our waiter was very nice and helpful and was again quick to help customize my vegetarian friend's needs.

"Quiet Storm is, perhaps, the most expensive vegetarian diner I have ever been to, even by big city standards! Cash-only makes this even more difficult. Tofu wings appetizer was simply not very good; and I usually love these things! I tried the gyro wrap which was also a big disappointment. As far as I know, gyros are supposed to be pretty meaty, but this was mostly lettuce with sporadic chunks of seitan and cucumber,along  with dreaded diced unripe tomato. The wrap was dry and upon looking at the menu again, I see that the sauce that it probably requires costs an extra $.50. The tortilla itself was very white and seemingly unnatural compared to those found at most veggie establishments. My beverage was good and affordable--ginger lemonade. It was sweet for my tastes, but I am sure most people would have thought it perfect. I'll keep Quiet Storm in mind as a coffee shop, only.\n\nF.Y.I after splitting the cost of the appetizer with a friend, my lunch cost me $17--ouch!

"Ugh... I got a plate with seisage, tofu scramble, and sundried tomato toast. My whole plate was entirely dry, chewy, and unpalatable.

"Pros:\n- At least there's a climbing gym in this area\n- Walls get reset often\n\nCons:\n- I've been coming here a couple times a week for the past few months now, and I have felt like some of the walls really need some padding besides the not-so-great spring board they have. The walls are pretty high and the height + lack of mats retract me from climbing certain routes, which is really disappointing because it ruins my climbing experience. \n- I brought up the aforementioned lack of mats to the woman who works here, and she snapped at me: \""""Mats are only supposed to be under walls that are sloped.\"""" I told her the wall I was talking about was sloped, and she replied curtly \""""If you don't feel comfortable climbing those walls without a mat, then you shouldn't even be climbing them.\"""" I was in shock. Is this a way you should be addressing your climbers' legitimate concerns? Even if it isn't possible to have mats, she could have at least told me in a nicer way instead of talking to me as if I knew nothing. \n- The gym closes at 11PM on Fridays.

"I was home for the holidays and wanted to take some friends of mine climbing.

With someone who isn't super comfortable down climbing or jumping from the top, I wasn't always super excited to fall when there wasn't a nice big cushion.  Those were only on the overhanging walls.\n\nThe place was super busy on a Sunday afternoon and group after group rolled in.

"There are some really good things to say about the climbing wall, but overall I was quite disappointed.  I wanted to like this place, so I'll start with the positive aspects.  \n\nFirst of all, the gym in pretty cheap.  And the bouldering area is really quite good.  To be honest, this should only be a bouldering gym. There were a lot of different volumes, nice routes, some top outs, and a good cave area.  Even a small crack with a few problems set on it. \n\nIt seems like whoever is in charge of setting the boulder problems really has some talent.  I might be back to bolder once in a blue moon.  The other climbers here were pretty cool, so the place might have a good vibe/community aspect. \n\n\nNow the downsides.  The staff wasn't very helpful.  The rules regarding the top rope area are nonsensical, and the only reasoning offered up was insurance. I wanted to belay for a friend, but he wasn't allowed in the top rope area unless belay tested. Belay testing also cost $5, and I hate when gyms charge for a test.  It's poor form. \n\nThe ropes aren't doubled up, and with the short wall it gives way too much pull.  They require you to clip into daisy chains on the ground.  I wanted to lead climb, but there was no one at the gym that could give a lead test. The TR routes were really hit or miss, a lot of them just confusing and not fun. They aren't rated properly, just easy, medium, or hard. \n\nThe walls are painted plywood, so smearing is basically impossible.  Further, I question if the holds have ever been cleaned.  Some of them are so polished to the point that it's dangerous.  \n\nThere's only once changing room, and overall the place isn't very clean.

"Shopping at Whole Foods this afternoon made us hungry and as we had no plans for dinner, my wife thought of Cafe Zinho, which is nearby.  I called and they said they were quite busy but if I could get there quickly, they had an open table for us.  Before hanging up they reminded me to bring a bottle of wine if I wanted one.  We made a quick stop at the nearby wine and spirits shoppe, bought a Spanish red, and showed up at Cafe Zinho.  They offered us the choice of two tables and immediately opened our wine, and brought over two nice stems.  The waiter gave us menus, described the daily specials and gave us time to mull it over.  We both ordered the soup of the day, a pumpkin bisque, my wife just ordered their Zhino side salad as her entree, and I chose a lamb burger (not Elysian Fields lamb, I asked).  Our waiter brought us a basket of what I suspect to be Portuguese bread.  It had a delicious sweetness. Our soups came out fairly quickly.  The bowls held a hearty serving of the delicious (and filling) cream soup.  After clearing our empty bowls our waiter bought out our entrees.  My wife's side salad was large, as side salads go.  She was quite pleased with it.  It had baby greens, tomato, olives, hearts & reduced red wine vinaigrette.  I had a taste and agreed with her assessment.  My lamb burger was huge!  It was at least an inch thick and was topped with feta and fruit chutney.  It came with a salad that filled any remaining space on the plate not taken up by the burger.

"This was the first time for me and my wife at the celebrated Cafe Zinho. Parking in the residential area in which the restaurant is located is next to impossible on a busy Saturday night; the diner should be prepared to walk a distance to get to the restaurant from where he or she is ultimately able to park.  The greatest drawback is that the restaurant is tiny and the seating so tight that at our table, it was necessary to sit uncomfortably in order to avoid being bumped by anyone that walked by, which happened repeatedly as we were in a busy thoroughfare of food delivery.  No other table offered a much better situation and all others were occupied at the busy time we arrived, 6:45 p. m. The online menu boasts of a daily vegetarian and vegan special entree, but there was no such entree on this night.  There was only one non-meat item on the small menu, ravioli.  Our gracious server, Ramon, said that the kitchen could prepare a couscous and vegetable dish if the vegetarian in our party wanted it, and that was what we did.  The restaurant permits customers to bring their own alcoholic beverages, a nice convenience and savings for the diner.  A small portion of bread was served with a tiny amount of rock-hard butter.  My mushroom and cheese soup was a large portion, served piping hot, which was great, but it was a puree with no distinct mushroom pieces.  I would not have been able to distinguish it as mushroom soup.  All of our entrees were attractively presented and were tasty, average size portions.  All were served with a small amount of good, fresh vegetables. It would be helpful if the menu offered some description of the following entree so that the diner with an interest in a chicken dish would not have to inquire about it of the server:  \""""chicken maputo\nRoasted w/ piri piri & chocolate scented sauce\"""".  Does the average diner know what \""""maputo\"""" and \""""piri piri\"""" are? The lemon tart dessert was a small piece not suitable for sharing, served with two minute pieces of strawberries and a small dollop of whipped cream.  It was not flavorful or moist nor worth the calories.  The gracious owner, Tony Pais, stopped at our table for a moment to greet us, a nice touch, and there were quality checks by a manager and Ramon.  I noticed a number of prominent people from the community dining here, individuals whom I was surprised were willing to spend a good deal of money to be packed into a sardine can of a restaurant.  Apparently they consider this to be the only restaurant in town.  The rest rooms are small, one-person facilities, naturally. An unfortunate surprise occurred when the individual that was picking up the check for my party presented his credit card only to be told that the restaurant accepts only cash and checks, this for a tariff of $148 plus gratuity.  It is supposed to be of some consolation that there is an Automatic Teller Machine on site.  I imagine less than 1% of expensive restaurants today are cash only.  Cafe Zinho is a highly flawed restaurant, demonstrating that there is more to a fine dining experience than simply offering fine cuisine.  If one is able to get beyond the feeling one has when visiting the rest room on a commercial airliner, the diner might enjoy it: not us.\n\nI posted comments about the restaurant at its Facebook page, in which I noted my displeasure with being cramped and uncomfortable, and about the restaurant being unique in its unwillingness to accept credit cards for a $148 check.  An individual identifying himself as the manager, who apparently had never received constructive criticism from anyone, initially demonstrated rage, posting a message that I can go to the Oiive Garden the next time I dine out.  He later added with similar condescension that I can use a coupon and a credit card at The Olive Garden.  Later, he thought better of his outburst and removed the comments...along with mine.  He ultimately offered me and my wife the opportunity to return to the restaurant at his expense.  I thanked him for the offer, but told him that one experience at Cafe Zinho was enough.

Does the averaging diner know what \""""maputo\"""" and \""""piri piri\"""" are? The lemon tart dessert was a little piece not suitable for shares, served with two minute slices of strawberries and a little dollop of horsewhipped cream.  It was not flavorful or wetter nor worth the calories.  The courteous owners, Tony Pais, halts at our tables for a moment to salute us, a nice touch, and there were quality audits by a manager and Ramon.  I noticed a number of prominent people from the community dining here, individuals whom I was surprised were willing to spend a good deal of money to be packed into a sardine can of a restaurant.  Apparently they consider this to be the only restaurant in town.  The rest rooms are small, one-person facilities, naturally. An unfortunate surprise occurred when the individual that was picking up the check for my party presented his credit card only to be told that the restaurant accepts only cash and checks, this for a tariff of $148 plus gratuity.  It is supposed to be of some consolation that there is an Automatic Teller Machine on site.  I imagine less than 1% of expensive restaurants today are cash only.  Cafe Zinho is a highly flawed restaurant, demonstrating that there is more to a fine dining experience than simply offering fine cuisine.  If one is able to get beyond the feeling one has when visiting the rest room on a commercial airliner, the diner maybe enjoy it: not us.\n\nI posted comments about the restaurant at its Facebook page, in which I noted my displeasure with being cramped and uncomfortable, and about the restaurant being unique in its unwillingness to accept credit cards for a $148 check.  An individual identifying himself as the manager, who apparently had never received constructive criticism from anyone, initially demonstrated rage, posting a message that I can go to the Oiive Garden the next time I dine out.  He later added with similar condescension that I can use a coupon and a credit card at The Olive Garden.  Later, he thought better of his outburst and removed the comments...along with mine.  He ultimately offered me and my wife the opportunity to return to the restaurant at his expense.  I thanked him for the offer, but told him that one experience at Cafe Zinho was enough.  I had no intention of returning even if he had responded to my comments like a gentleman.",Failed

"What an absolutely delightful and special dining experience!  Our family of four went there for dinner this past Friday night.  Brought along  two  bottles of wine, which is such a nice bonus. Much cheaper and we were able to bring wines that we enjoy.  The decor is lovely, very bohemian and cozy.  Just magical.  Our server was Bulgarian and very knowledgeable about the menu and the specials.  The food is Portuguese, which is primarily fish based, so we ordered accordingly. To start we ordered the cod fritters, the grilled octopus and a special salad of the night, farm grown tomatoes with Roquefort cheese.  All very delicious!  Main courses were lamb burger with caramelized onions and provolone (tremendous flavor), the impeccable seafood stew and the salmon, also lovely.  Just a perfect relaxing meal in every way.

It is a bite over priced for the sizing, but it is perpetually really good.\n\nSunday brunch\nA adjacent talked me into going here for the brunch and I was pleased she did. For an all you can eaten brunch they do a nice job conserving things stocked and fresh. The omelet chef was very good making stuff just as you requested him for, yum.

"We stayed here and was initially disappointed-- being new to town, our first impression was that Pittsburgh was a very very bad town full of homeless and degenerates (the area, I find out later, is one of the worst spots in the city!).  The hotel is located across the street from a housing authority building.  Projects?  UGH.  Great.  \n\nThen we were put into a \""""historical\"""" room that was similar to that of a rundown cheap apartment-- old shower stall, moldy threadbare carpeting, lumpy squeaky bed.  \n\nI find out an hour later (after freaking out about the lo-end aspect of this room) that they have new rooms that were just recently renovated.  I asked to see the room, and then ultimately change to that room-- for a fee, of course.  About 50% more expensive.  But I pay more because NO WAY would I be able to exist in this old \""""historical\"""" creepy room.  \n\nFinally, a regular room-- the \""""renovated\"""" room was similar to that of an acceptable hotel room.  Why even keep this historical, old, dingy, dirty room?  Do they figure unsuspecting people who don't know any better will just accept it b/c they have no other choice?? \n\nI slept well in the \""""new\"""" renovated room, and would have been freaked out all night in the old room. What a difference. Actually, the bed and linens were very, very comfortable.  The bathroom was nice and clean.  The room was what I expected a hotel room to be... not high end four seasons, but not cheap and nasty either. \n\nThe hotel obviously had availabilities of the new, renovated rooms, so why put us in an old, unrenovated, ugly old apartment looking room? If they believed in upgrading, then they would have at least gotten repeat business!! For those who are going to book here, pay more for the new rooms, or go somewhere else.  The option of staying in the old room should not be an option at all.  \n\nI don't think I will ever go back here if I ever go back to Pittsburgh.
